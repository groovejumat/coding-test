## my solution
```python
def solution(priorities, location):
    priormax = max(priorities)
    print(priorities)
    print(len(priorities))
    # for i in range(priorities):
    #     print(i)
    while len(priorities) > 1 :
        # 지속적으로 검증 
        for index, value in enumerate(priorities):
            if priormax == value : 
                print(index, value)
                priormax = max(priorities)
                priorities.pop(index)

            print(index, value)

        answer = 0
        
    return answer
```
